Pre-Development Assessment:
    From what I can see in the mockups we have really two basic objects here: A 
    todo list (which we can have many of), and a todo list item (which has a 
    couple of properties).  A todo list has: 0 - many list items, a name. A todo
    list item has: a name, completed (boolean).

Languages:
    Back-end can be written in (really) any language, so we'll go with PHP.
    This back-end will be a RESTful API for our task app.  We communicate with 
    JSON and use the standard CRUD commands for HTML (POST, GET, PUT, and 
    DELETE - We'll skip PATCH for now).  Our PHP application runs on Apache (we 
    could use nginx but it doesn't support DELETE or PUT natively).

    Our backend stores data in a database, we'll go with mySQL due to its 
    pervasiveness.  The database will have two tables: one for todo lists and 
    one for todo list items.  todo lists will have a 0-to-many relationship with
    the todo list items table.  

    The front end will be a simple HTML/CSS interface and I would use 
    CoffeeScript, Spine (or Backbone), and jQuery to do the user interaction and
    communication with the PHP REST API.

Testing:
    Unit tests can be written for the front end via qUnit (unit testing library
    I am most familiar with) or some other unit testing library.  We'll want to
    write some tests for our backend too so we'll use PHPunit because the 
    documentation looks solid and I've played with it a little bit.

Deployment:
    There are lots of different deploy strategies out there, so here's my take 
    on the best option.  Our database will be configured once, ideally we will 
    never have to touch it again unless we are making major changes to our 
    application.  Code for both the front end and back end components can be 
    deployed through the AWS beanstalk provided we are using Amazon for our 
    hosting.  We can configure beanstalk to run unit and integration tests when 
    it has new data pushed to then finally deploy the code and start the servers 
    (if necessary).  This makes it possible for us to have a one-button deploy 
    (well, one command).

I'm sure there's substantially more that could be said about this simple 
application but this is the basic pattern that I would use to build and deploy 
such an application.
